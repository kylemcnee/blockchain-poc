# Blockchain Proof of Concept Demo
This is a command line demo for generating a Blockchain with a handful of Blocks for the purpose of 
demonstrating how Blockchain technology works.  I made this because explaining the Blockchain verbally
can sometimes be daunting, and I've found that it's easier to present those curious with
a set of data they can manipulate and witness how their changes result in wildly different hashes.

Each block contains Strings with placeholder information about the transactions that have taken place.  Two of the placeholders are close friends of mine, the other two I picked out of a hat 
(I thought "Rob" and "Frank" would suffice for that purpose).  Show this to your teachers, your Iguana, your eccentric billionaire uncle
whom you've been trying to squeeze for startup funding for the better part of a decade, or just use it alone in your bedroom.  This is a No Shame license.  I'm working on what that means, but for the time being the law of Thelema applies (i.e. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.  Love is law, love under will...oh for chirssake just credit me!)
